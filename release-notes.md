# Release notes
{: #release-notes}

The following sections document the new features and changes that were included for each release of the {{site.data.keyword.wh-acdshort}} service. Unless otherwise noted, all changes are compatible with earlier releases and are automatically and transparently available to all new and existing applications.
{: shortdesc}

The release notes document the *service version* and *interface version* for all recent updates. You specify the *interface version* with the `version` query parameter to use new features and functionality made available with that update. The service returns both versions with the `X-Service-Api-Version` response header.  ???
