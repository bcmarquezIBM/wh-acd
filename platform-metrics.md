# IBM Cloud Monitoring integration
{: #monitor-pm}

{{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} is a third-party, cloud-native, and container-intelligent management system that you can include as part of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} architecture. Use it to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services, and platforms. It offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers full-stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards. 
{:shortdesc}

Currently, {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} integration is available for {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} deployments according to the following table:

Deployment Region | {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} Region
----------|-----------
`Dallas` | `Dallas`
`Washington DC` | `Washington DC`
{: caption="Table 1. Monitoring regions" caption-side="top"}

## Platform metrics overview
{: #platform_metrics-pm}

You can configure only one instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service per region to collect platform metrics.
* To configure the Monitoring instance, you must turn on the *platform metrics* configuration setting.
* If a Monitoring instance in a region is already enabled to collect platform metrics, metrics from enabled-Sysdig services are collected automatically and available for monitoring through this instance. For more information about enabled-monitoring instances, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/services).

To monitor platform metrics, check that the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance is provisioned in the same region where the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance is provisioned.
{: important}

## Enabling platform metrics from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard
{: #enable_platform_metrics-pm}

Complete the following steps to configure platform metrics:

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

    The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard opens.

2. Click **View all** in the Resource summary section of the dashboard.

3. In the *Services* section, click the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance that you plan to monitor.

    The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI *Manage* page opens.

4. Click **Actions** > **Add monitoring** to configure *platform metrics* in the region of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance.

    If the menu choices include the **Monitoring** option, then your instance is already configured for platform metrics.
    {: note}

6. Provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service.

   After you provision the Monitoring instance, the *Observabvility* page opens. To continue working with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, go back to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI.
   {: note}

## Viewing metrics
{: #view_metrics}

To monitor {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} metrics, you must launch the Monitoring web UI instance that is enabled for platform metrics in the region where your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance is available.
{: important}

There are different options to launch the Monitoring web UI and monitor metrics that are described in the following section.

### Launching Monitoring web UI from the {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} dashboard
{: #view_metrics_opt1}

Complete the following steps to launch the Monitoring web UI from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard:

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

   The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard opens.

2. Click **View all** in the Resource summary section of the dashboard.

3. In the *Services* section, click the {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} instance that you plan to monitor.

   The {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} *Manage* page opens.

4. Click the **Actions** menu, and select **Monitoring**.

   A new tab in your browser opens and displays the *Default* dashboard named ** {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} ** within the context of your {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} instance.

### Launching Monitoring web UI from the Observability page
{: #view_metrics_opt2}

Complete the following steps to launch the Monitoring web UI from the *Observability* page:

1. [Launch the Monitoring web UI](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-launch).
2. Click **DASHBOARDS**.
3. In the **Default Dashboards** section, expand **{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}**.
4. Choose the {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} dashboard from the list.

   To access your deployment's Monitoring dashboard, it's in the sidebar, under {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}.

   Next, change the scope or make a copy of the *Default* dashboard to monitor an {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} instance.

## Monitoring {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}}

Consider the following tasks when you monitor your account in the {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} service:

| Task                                      | Predefined alert | What to look for  |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Monitor the occurrence of 4xx errors. | Frequent 4xx Responses | When 4xx errors occur, there's an issue on the client side in sending data to {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} for analysis. Check your application settings to ensure you're using the proper endpoint, credentials, http headers, etc. |
| Monitor the occurrence of 5xx errors. | Frequent 5xx Responses | When 5xx errors occur, there's an issue with the service whereby it cannot successfully process input. These errors are usually temporary, but may require switching over to another region in the event of a severe regional outage. See [Disaster recovery](/docs/wh-acd?topic=wh-acd-troubleshoot#troubleshoot_deploy_timeout) for further details. |
| Monitor the occurrence of slow response time averages. | Slow Response Time Averages | An increase in average response times could result from additional annotators being deployed for analysis, an increase in the amount of data being analyzed, or increased service traffic at the time of analysis. |
{: caption="Table 1. Pre-defined alerts" caption-side="top"}

## {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} Predefined Dashboards
{: #acd_dashboards_dictionary}

The following table outlines the pre-defined dashboards that you can use to monitor {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} metrics:

| Dashboard name        | Description    |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| `{{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}}` | Dashboard visualizing important {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} metrics. |
{: caption="Table 2. Pre-defined dashboards" caption-side="top"}

The *Default* dashboard can't be changed. You can copy the dashboard so that you can make changes to suit your requirements.
{: important}

When you start your dashboard, some metrics might display a `Data Load Error` warning icon. This warning is because not enough time has elapsed to create the data. When data is available, the warning sign goes away and the metric is populated.
