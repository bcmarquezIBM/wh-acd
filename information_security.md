## Deleting User Data 
{: #gdpr-in-service}

{{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} does not store the unstructured data submitted to the /analyze APIs for analysis. The only user data stored is the optional configuration data submitted in the form of a cartridge to the /deploy API as well as an any profiles or flows a user may optionally define outside of a cartridge deployment. Cartridge artifacts, flows, and profiles are persisted centrally and distributed to ACD nodes and cached locally on the node. Delete APIs are provided for flows and profiles and there is a delete /user_data API available for removing persisted user data associated with an service instance. Deprovisioning your service instance will remove all instance specific data artifacts from the master database as well as from the local cache on all ACD nodes. Backups of user data are created daily for disaster recovery; these backups are deleted after 14 days."
