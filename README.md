# Repository Workflow

1. Create a `dev-personal` branch  for your changes. 
2. Update the markdown documentation files and **push** the changes to the `dev-personal` branch.
3. Open **pull request** from your `dev-personal` branch for the commits to go to the `staging`.
4. This kicks off a build and make sure it's clean via **#apis-wh-acd** slack channel.
5. View the published docs here: https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/wh-acd?topic=wh-acd-getting-started
