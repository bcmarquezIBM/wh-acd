# Living Assistance
{: #living_assistance}

The living assistance annotators identifies text that indicates if a patient needs assistance with daily activities.  There are six living assistance annotators that cover different types of assistance needs:  Bathing, dressing, eating, seeing, toileting, and walking.

### Bathing Assistance

This daily living activities annotator identifies text that indicates whether a patient needs any type of assistance while bathing or taking shower. Additionally, the annotator will also identify patients who potentially needing help if the text mentions patient is having difficulty with a specific bathing task such as needing help washing feet.

### Eating Assistance

This daily living activities annotator identifies text that indicates whether a patient needs any type of assistance consuming food. This will include any type of food consumption such as eating, drinking, chewing, swallowing, etc. Furthermore, the annotator will also identify difficulty using utensils as potentially needing help with eating such as `difficulty holding a fork and a knife`.
