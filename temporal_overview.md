# Temporal Overview (Experimental)
{: #temporal_overview}

{{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} can detect temporal expressions and link them to related concepts as contextual features. This temporal capability is currently available through [Clinical Insights](/docs/wh-acd?topic=wh-acd-clinical_insights_overview#clinical_insights_overview).  

The {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} [demo application](https://acd-try-it-out.mybluemix.net/preview) allows you to see how temporal linking works.  In the screenshot below, hovering over _hip surgery_ shows that is linked to the date _5/17_.

Concepts are linked to dates by JSON structures described below.  Support for some non-date temporal entities like durations and relative dates will be added later.


#### temporal

<table>
<tr><th>__Field__</th><th>__Description__</th></tr>
</tr><td>begin</td><td>The start position of the temporal entity as a character offset into the text.  The smallest possible start position is 0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>end</td><td>The end position of the temporal entity as a character offset into the text. The end position points at the first character after the annotation, such that end-begin equals the length of the coveredText.</td></tr>
<tr><td>temporalType</td><td>Provides information about the type of a temporal entity.  Currently, _dateScore_ is the only score provided in this section.  Anything that scores sufficiently low as a date will not be surfaced.  For example, in the image above _2/10_ in the context of the patient's current pain level scores low as a date and is not surfaced. </td></tr>
</tr><td>relationType</td><td>Provides information about how the temporal entity relates to an entity.  Currently, _overlapsScore_ is the only relation type defined and it indicates how strongly the temporal entity is linked to the concept.</td></tr>
</table>

It is possible for multiple temporal links to be added to a concept.  For example, given the following text:

_PMH: Patient had bariatric revision surgery in April 1999 and again in July 2003, knee replacement in 2011, and underwent arthroscopic surgery on her shoulder in 2016._

The temporal section for _revision surgery_ would have two associated dates.

```        
"temporal": [{
		"begin": 47,
		"end": 57,
		"coveredText": "April 1999",
		"temporalType": {
			"dateScore": 1
		},
		"relationTypes": {
			"overlapsScore": 0.988
		}
	},
	{
		"begin": 71,
		"end": 80,
		"coveredText": "July 2003",
		"temporalType": {
			"dateScore": 1
		},
		"relationTypes": {
			"overlapsScore": 0.923
		}
	}
]
```
