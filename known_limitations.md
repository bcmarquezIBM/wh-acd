# Known Limitations
{: #known_limitations}

## Text Size Limits

{{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} imposes a 50K limit on text being analyzed per request. For json requests, the json metadata does not count towards the 50K threshold. The {{site.data.keyword.wh-acd_short}} /analyze APIs will return a 413 error if the input text exceeds the 50K threshold.

## Cartridge Deployment Timeouts

Cartridge deployments via the /deploy API can sometimes exceed the one minute timeout threshold for services to provide a response. When the timeout is exceeded, a 504 response is returned in html format. Despite the 504 response, the deploy operation will continue to completion. In the event of a deployment timeout, you can verify successful deployment of the cartridge through the deploy [Activity Tracker](wh-acd?topic=wh-acd-at_events) event.

## Multiple Unstructured Array Elements

While multiple unstructured array elements with text values may be submitted in a single request, 40 unstructured array elements is the recommended limit to avoid performance degradation due to processing overhead.

## Cartridge Use While Deployment in Progress

When a cartridge is in the midst of being deployed or re-deployed, use of the flows therein for text analysis should be avoided until cartridge deployment has successfully completed. Use of cartridge flows while the cartridge is actively being deployed may yield unexpected results.
