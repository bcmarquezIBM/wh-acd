# Spell Check
{: #spell_check}

This annotator identifies misspelled words and phrases in a document and suggests corrections.  You can use the spell check annotator as a standalone preprocessing step for your data or it can be used as part of a larger annotator flow.

Spell check can also be configured to recognize and correct to surface forms in custom dictionaries if the dictionaries are enabled for spell check in the cartridge configuration.
