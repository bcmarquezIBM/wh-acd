Annotation customization can be carried out using either _filters_ or _whitelists_. _Filtering_ is the ability to define conditional filtering of annotations based on response annotation field values to address false-positive or otherwise non-applicable annotations. _Whitelists_ provide the ability to define additional surface forms for an annotator to address false-negatives.

The Filter and Whitelist content that follows describes how to provide customization definitions at request time or how to specify use of a stored configuration at request time.
