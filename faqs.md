## How should I set up my page?
{: #faq-page-setup}
{: faq}


* Use "FAQs" as your title.
* Name the file `faqs.md` for SEO. If you require multiple FAQ files, use a unique name for each one.
* Add each question as an H2.
* Use paragraph text following the associated H2 question for each answer.
* Enable your TOC so the list of questions shows in the right nav.
* Set the `faq` content type attribute at the top of your file.
* Set the `faq` content type attribute on a new line following each H2 question.

## What should I include in my FAQs?
{: #faq-content-include}
{: faq}

Each answer should be approximately one to five sentences. You want to make sure you are not re-documenting information that is already available in documentation because then you'd have to maintain it in two places. If a more detailed explanation for the question exists out in a documentation page, give a concise answer here, and then link out to the doc.

For detailed guidance on what to include on this page, see [FAQs guidance](/docs/developing/writing/faq.html#faqs). You can also check out some examples here: [IBM Cloud IAM FAQs](/docs/developing/Access-Management/iamfaq.html#faqs) and [Account FAQs](/docs/account/account_faq.html#accountfaqs).
